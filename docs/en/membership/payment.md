## Common Questions

### Payment rejected by card issuer?

If you are a user from mainland China and use UnionPay, Alipay or WeChat Pay bound to bank cards issued by Chinese banks for payment, there is a certain probability of payment failure, because some bank cards issued by Chinese banks do not have cross-border payment functions enabled by default.

At this time, you need to call UnionPay customer service center 95516 or your card issuer's customer service center to confirm whether your card has overseas transaction services enabled.

For cards with overseas transactions enabled and bearing the UnionPay logo, including debit cards, credit cards, and quasi-credit cards, all can be used.

### Can I get an invoice for membership purchase?

Jego is an overseas company and has not established a main company in mainland China, so we cannot issue mainland China invoices.

For membership purchases, we can provide formal Invoices issued by overseas main companies. After each payment, the system will automatically send the Invoice to your registered email and provide a PDF version for download. If you need to reimburse the Invoice, please consult your finance department first.

If you don't receive the relevant email, please check your email, including the spam folder. If you need further assistance, please contact our customer support team.
