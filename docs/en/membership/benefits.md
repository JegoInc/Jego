::: info VIP Rules Explanation
### VIP duration is cumulative

If you purchase 2 monthly cards in one day, your VIP duration will be <span style="color:green;">`62`</span> days.

If your VIP duration still has <span style="color:green;">`3`</span> days, after you purchase a monthly card, your VIP duration will be <span style="color:green;">`31+3`</span> days.

### VIP level is rounded

The VIP level calculation method is to use your account's VIP <span style="color:green;">`remaining duration รท 30`</span> after payment, then <span style="color:green;">`round`</span>, with a minimum value of <span style="color:green;">`1`</span>.

If your remaining VIP duration after payment is <span style="color:green;">`45`</span> days, <span style="color:green;">`45 รท 30 = 1.5`</span> then your VIP level is <span style="color:green;">`2`</span>

If your remaining VIP duration after payment is <span style="color:green;">`44`</span> days, <span style="color:green;">`44 รท 30 = 1.47`</span> then your VIP level is <span style="color:green;">`1`</span>

If your remaining VIP duration after payment is <span style="color:green;">`10`</span> days, <span style="color:green;">`10 รท 30 = 0.33`</span> then your VIP level is <span style="color:green;">`1`</span>

<span style="color:red;">**Note:**</span><span style="color:red;">VIP level is not calculated and changed in real time, it is only calculated when your account has settlement actions (purchase, expiration).</span>
