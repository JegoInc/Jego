# Fair Use

## Multi-person Sharing

One account can be used simultaneously on up to 6 of your own devices.

But to ensure service/route quality, we do not allow multiple people (more than 6 devices) to share one account, as this will cause us to make incorrect judgments about bandwidth and architecture. To prevent incorrect judgments, we therefore prohibit multiple people from sharing one account.

Once we discover long-term multi-person sharing of one account, we will <span style="color:red;">permanently ban</span> that account.

## Fair Use

Please do not use Jego for BT, magnet links, Xunlei and other P2P software downloads <span style="color:red;">(permanent ban once discovered);</span>

Please do not use Jego to **watch high-definition videos for long periods** or download large software;

Within one month, if you exceed three times of long periods (long period defined as greater than 60 minutes) occupying up to 100 M per second data usage, you can still maintain unlimited data traffic usage, but traffic speed will slow down from maximum 100 M per second to maximum 1 M per second (applies to upload and download).

## Abuse Behavior

Please do not use Jego's provided services to attack others' devices, scam others' property, infringe on others' property rights, and other illegal activities with third-party victims.
