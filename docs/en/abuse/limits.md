# Traffic Limits

## Jego Extension

The Jego proxy extension on computer browsers currently has <span style="color:orange;">**no traffic limits**</span>, but to ensure other users' experience, please do not occupy excessive traffic for long periods affecting other users.

## Jego Subscription

Jego's subscription service has <span style="color:orange;">**traffic limits**</span> each month. Your specific traffic package size can be found in the **Control Panel - Mobile Subscription** page in the upper right corner **"Monthly Remaining Traffic"** (if it's negative, it means the traffic package is completely used up), and please arrange usage reasonably.

Note: There are two conditions for Jego subscription monthly traffic package used traffic to reset:

1. At the beginning of each natural month, used traffic will reset;
2. When payment occurs, used traffic will reset.

After used traffic resets, you will have a brand new traffic package for that month.
