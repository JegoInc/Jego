## sing-box Common Issues

### ðŸš« Cannot access foreign websites but can access domestic websites?

**ðŸŸ¡ Situation 1: Just started**

When sing-box just starts, before processing foreign domain name resolution, it will first conduct a URL speed test on all available nodes to select the fastest node to complete subsequent DNS resolution. Therefore, before the speed test is completed, you may temporarily be unable to access foreign websites.

> âœ… Solution: If you don't want to wait for the speed test process, you can manually select an available node, so you can immediately access foreign websites.

**ðŸŸ¡ Situation 2: Same problem occurs during use**

If you also suddenly cannot access foreign websites during use, it's likely that the currently selected node is unavailable or has poor connection quality.

> âœ… Solution: Please check the connectivity of the current node, and manually switch to a stable available node when necessary to restore access.

**ðŸ’¡** Note: This problem will not affect access to domestic websites, nor will it affect the use of services based on foreign IP (such as Telegram), only affecting access to foreign domain name websites.
