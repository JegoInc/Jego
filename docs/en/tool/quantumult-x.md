## Proxy Mode

Long press the main function icon in the bottom right corner of the client homepage to quickly switch between different proxy modes.

* Yellow icon represents **All Direct**, meaning all traffic does not go through proxy relay, equivalent to not turning on the proxy switch.
* Colorful icon represents **Rule-based Traffic Routing**, meaning the client automatically judges whether proxy network data is needed according to the rule set in the configuration file, **recommended to switch to this mode for use**.
* Blue icon represents **All Proxy**, meaning all traffic must go through proxy relay. This mode is only recommended when rule-based traffic routing cannot be used, otherwise it will consume too much traffic and cause some domestic sites to not be accessible normally.
