# ClashBox

ClashBox/ClashNEXT is the first proxy software based on the Navigation framework for HarmonyOS NEXT(OpenHarmony) platform, using a modified Mihomo(ClashMeta) kernel.

Welcome to the 2025 ClashBox/ClashNEXT usage tutorial

::: danger Note
ClashBox is not yet open source, please use with caution.

**Software Features**

ArkTS Development: The frontend is developed using ArkTS, more fluid with richer animations;

Cool Interface: Uses HarmonyOS NEXT design style, adopts UI layout design similar to [Surfboard](/en/tool/surfboard), supports dark mode, blur effects, etc., providing a further improved user experience;

Multi-device Adaptation: UI has been adapted for phones, tablets, foldable screens, HarmonyOS computers and even PuraX outer screen*;

Stable Kernel: Uses the widely praised [Mihomo(ClashMeta)](/en/tool/mihomo) kernel, with functions basically aligned with Mihomo(ClashMeta), stable and reliable;

Core Recovery: Due to HarmonyOS NEXT's background scheduling mechanism not being mature yet, the software may have background processes killed by the system, so ClashBox has built-in core recovery functionality. After the system kills the process, the core process will be automatically restored (this function will be automatically enabled after turning on "Background Running - Simulate Picture-in-Picture").
