## Select Proxy Mode

### **Rule Mode: Only proxy overseas traffic**

Suitable for users who use both domestic and international services.

Mainland traffic does not consume package data.

When querying IP on mainland websites, you get the local IP address.

When querying IP on overseas websites, you get the proxy IP address.

Traffic routing rules cannot be comprehensive and have timeliness. If you encounter the following situations, try global proxy.

* Unable to open international websites;
* Slow loading of international websites;

### **Global Mode: Proxy all traffic**

All traffic goes through the proxy server, suitable for scenarios requiring global proxy access, users who don't rely on mainland services.

Very effective for overseas traffic, mainland traffic will be slowed down.

### **Direct Mode: No proxy for any traffic**

Selecting this mode will route all traffic without going through proxy server nodes, but through the Mihomo kernel to forward to the target server, which will result in inability to bypass restrictions, same effect as not using VPN.
