#### Routing Mode

The function of routing is to send incoming data to different outbound connections according to needs, to achieve on-demand proxy. A common usage of this function is to route domestic and foreign traffic, which can judge traffic from different regions through internal mechanisms, and then send them to different outbound proxies. There are three routing modes to choose from.

* Bypass Mainland (Whitelist) mode: That is, the whitelist in the original version, only websites in the whitelist access the internet through node server proxy
* Blacklist mode: Except for websites in the blacklist, all other websites access the internet through node server proxy
* Global mode: All websites access the internet through node server proxy

Choose the appropriate routing mode according to different needs, generally choose whitelist mode.
